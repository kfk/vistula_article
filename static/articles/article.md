##First day
<a id="a_AS1"></a>
We were eating inside the outer tent. We were cooking one of my culinary inventions for getting high calories and decent taste: pasta boiled in Polish can pork meat and a vegetarian bouillon cube for taste enhancement. We were in the outer tent because outside a gazillion of mosquitoes was trying to eat us alive like if suddenly they decided to punish us for all the repellents humanity inflicted upon them. We were there, sitting uncomfortable, with a potential fire hazard boiling in our tent and I was thinking : man, this kayak trip in Poland is going to be huge!

This was our first day. We had been planning, actually, Freek had been planning, I was playing along. I was saying, we had been planning this trip for almost a year. We chose Poland and its Vistula because we wanted to go East and, for me, because I was genuinely curious about a country I had been only once in Krakow. Vistula is a long river, it divides Poland in two and it runs across most of the country, from Barania Gora to Gdansk, for about 1,000 km.

##The Plan
We decided very early that we were going to start from Krakow and that we were going to shoot for the whole thing up to Gdansk, something like 850 km of kayaking. The reason to start from Krakow is very straightforward: we managed to find there a great kayak club, with a great guy, Pawel, that not only rented us the canoe, but also came to take the canoe back in Gdansk! Our first start with Polish people was great. 

Pawel also helped us buying a kayak cart from a Polish supplier and then he bought it from us after our trip. A kayak cart for a trip like this can make the difference between reaching or not your destination. Say you have had a really tough day, with rain and you are super wet. Add on top that you are in an area of the river riddled with mosquitoes and you are not prepared for mosquitoes,  then reaching that hostel at 1km from the river can make a very big impact on your trip and your motivation.

The reasons to get up to Gdansk were: 1) it was just super cool to reach the Baltic sea; 2) we were betting that with a good canoe (by good I mean not inflatable), we could do about 70-80km a day in average; 3) did I mention it was cool to reach the baltic sea?

This time we had a GPS and we prepared to use it. We downloaded the map of Poland from Open Street Map and we took notes of all the important points along the river: supermarkets in deserted areas, hostels, camping sites, dams, locks. Freek also visually checked all the river on Gogle Earth, this is also a great way to find camp spots and the like. 
This planning worked perfectly. I am in strong support of a GPS even for just kayaking on a river: 

1. it gives you a way to track kilometers, and this is very important so to balance your trip as you go along to reach your destination.

2. it gives you a way to keep the right direction. Yes, it is a river and it goes always in one direction. But with big, wide and wild rivers, the direction is not always clear. You will find it, of course, but you waste a lot of precious energy in the process. Note, there is so much calories you can absorb in a day and you can’t transport too much food on a canoe either.

The Gear
Besides the GPS, we had a lot of other gear of course (me and Freek seem to have an over-gearing attitude). I am going to list below those I found more important:

1. Camping stove. It gives you something warm in the morning (tea) and something warm in the evening (pasta in can meat in this case). It is very efficient and one medium can will last you over two weeks.

2. Tent. Duh you say. Yes, but one thing, keep in mind to get one that can stand normal winds, that is light and that you can mount relatively easily. We have a Quechua T2 Ultralight Pro. It is very affordable, costs EUR 80, and you will not start crying if it breaks.

3. Dry bags. Duh again. Yes, but get them, there is absolutely nothing waterproof outside the dry bags. Repeat with me: there is nothing waterproof outside the dry bags.

4. Cameras. Get at least one that is either waterproof or cheap enough that you can use in rainy days without praying the gods that it won’t break.

5. Knife. Go for a steel one.

6. Spoon and fork and a good glass. 

7. Ropes. Both good ones and cheap ones.

8. Pharma. At the very least, you will have blisters. And anyway, anything can happen, have a pharma bag (you can buy one in the outdoor shops).

9. A sleeping bag, an inflatable mat that occupies as less space as possible, an inflatable pillow.

10. Waterproof and windproof jackets. We did not have them, so I am going to put them here to say: get them. There are some good cheap ones around (below EUR 100) and you will need them. Spend a day in rain a wind and you realize a good jacket is your best friend.

Of course, we had many other things, but I wanted to give a picture of the important ones. Nobody thinks a spoon or a pillow are important in a trip like this, yet those are the things you will miss the most if you don’t have them.

The River
During our trip, we saw the Vistula transforming completely. The river we started with, a small river with high banks, became first a sea, with sand beaches and hot sun, then a mess of islands and trees, then a lake with amazingly clean water and astonishing bird fauna, then again a river, then a water way and finally we were at a few kilometers from the real sea. 

After Warsaw, we started facing more “extreme” conditions: rain, wind and cold. We felt really cold, especially because we had no proper jackets. There was a day, a day we were trying to reach a castle on a side attribute of the Vistula in the middle of nowhere (I stopped wondering how Freek finds these things long time ago), this day I felt cold in a way I have never felt before. However bad the weather got, we kept pushing and paddling. One particular day we made about 100km, mostly because we could not find a camping site but it still counts, right?

The Food
Being Italian, the section on food is mandatory. Polish food is what in Italy we would call “winter food”. There is a lot of pork, sausages, soups, glass vegetables and, what I specialized in: pierogi (sort of ravioli). I must say, we probably ate a pig in 2 in those 2 weeks. We kept eating all we could as we were paddling over 7-8 hours a day, we still lost weight (startup idea: weight loss kayaking trips). At some point I was spreading pork fat on the bread (Polish delicacy, try it, it’s not as bad as it sounds).

This trip was about maturing. Me and Freek did another kayak trip, in 2012. We went kayaking on the Danube from Passau, shooting for Budapest, quite unprepared and using an inflatable canoe packed with a trolley (yes, trolley, with wheels). We did not reach Budapest (of course, I might add), but we did reach Bratislava. This time we had a GPS, a real canoe, no trolley packing.

And what about the future? We are considering Iceland for next year. We will not travel across the country this time, we will rent a car and kayak all over the place! We will visit fjords, lakes and rivers. We will see icebergs and, with luck, some of those nordic/sea animals you don’t find in continental Europe. If you have any suggestion, are living in Iceland, or anything, do contact me.
